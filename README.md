# Big4-Case-Interview
This is an example of an interview for a data science position at a Big 4 company. Have fun!
## THE PROBLEM
Telco is a Colombian Fintech related with telecommunications services. Its flagship product has been experiencing a higher churn rate, which would affect the company's revenue.
As a data scientist, you are requiered to develop a sistem to analyze churn prediction.

## Final product
Your project deliverable consists of three main components. Component 1 is a code project (R, Python,etc), whichever you are more comfortable with) in which you process and model customer data. Component 2 consists of a business proposal for Telco in which you portrait a solution sketch to continuously deploy the model results for them to be consumable to key stakeholders and decision makers. 
### Component 1
Your code project must have, and will be evaluated as such, the following characteristics:
* Your code should be readable and understandable, any step in your workflow should be transparent
* Be completely reproducible in any computer (including random split seed)
* Contain at least a data folder and a code folder
* At least contain sections within your code for each step in your workflow
* A README file with an overall description of the problem statement, the technology/model used and a high-level description of the code functionality.
* All code should be documented, hard coded input logic explained, model hyperparameter tuning explained, cleaning steps and preprocessing logics etc.
* Organized methodology: Data Cleansing, transformation, testing/training, etc.
### Component 2
What we are expecting to see:
* 3 – 7 minimal executive slide deck (Not including title slide or section slides)
* 1 slide, Intro/Your understanding of the problem, brief introduction of the study case
* 1 – 2 slides, EDA, Data findings derived from a clear data exploration process. (Relevant insight only)
* 1 – 2 slides, Model Choice & Results, Reliable machine learning model - you will be asked to explain the metrics used for the evaluation.
* Explanation of the results, why is your model the best model for the client?
* 1 Slide describing a minimal team ensemble describing key roles of each member.
* 1 slide sketch of an End 2 End solution to continuously deploy your model. Sketch should contain steps since data ingestion up to a BI tool and the technologies used.
